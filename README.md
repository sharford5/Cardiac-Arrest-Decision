<!-- Introduction -->
## Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) Decision Modeling
Welcome to the repository for our deep learning model focused on predicting decision for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care process. This project leverages cutting-edge techniques in deep learning to contribute to the field of emergency medicine and improve patient care.


### Overview
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a critical medical emergency that requires swift and accurate interventions. This repository hosts a deep learning model designed to predict the likelihood specific care being given to a patient based on a variety of input features. By harnessing the power of data-driven predictions, we aim to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions during high-stress situations.

This work contributes:
* Evaluation of the process of care and determination of who is responsible for care at each step
* Use of CARES data to model hospital side decisions of patients that survived to the emergency room
* Baseline results using CARES data achieved an AUROC of >86% for the different hospital side decisions
